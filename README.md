Following is the description for each directory in this repository:

* Coursera_ML_Andrew_Ng

Contains solutions to programming assignment and few of the Quizes across all the weeks. Each week contains ONLY those code files which are supposed to be modified to successfully submit the entire programming assignment.

* NPTEL_Data structures & Algorithms

This directory contains code of programming assignment for the course tiled as 'Design and analysis of algorithms' over NPTEL which covers popular data structures and algorithms. I tried to submit the solutions using Python. For each week's assignment I have shared the problem statement and corresponding solution in Jupyter Notebook.

Note that there were no programming assignments for Week 1, Week 5 and Week 8. Although, there was an assignment for Week 7 but I wasn't able to finish it. However, we were supposed to submit only 4 programming assignments in order to pass the course successfully.
