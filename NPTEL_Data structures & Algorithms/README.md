# Design_of_algorithms
This repository contains code of programming assignment for the course tiled as Design and analysis of algorithms which was offered at NPTEL during Jan-March 2019. I tried to submit the solutions using Python. For each week I have shared the problem statement and corresponding solution in Jupyter Notebook.

Note that there were no programming assignments for Week 1, Week 5 and Week 8. Although, there was an assignment for Week 7 but I wasn't able to finish it. However, we were supposed to submit only 4 programming assignments in order to pass the course successfully.
